  * How to go back in the user's history within one tab?  This will be needed if you click on one of the previous accordion pages within a tab wedge.

  * How to preload a screenshot to figure out its dimensions in a way that the code only resumes after the image is loaded and the dimensions determined?

  * How to integrate the SVG visualization into the chrome instead inserting it into the current webpage?

  * What is the best place to store the log file(s) and screenshots?  There were some problems with writing to the extension's directory so the log file is in a subdirectory of the Firefox profile folder now.  But I need to access the screenshots through a chrome URL, so I put them into the extension's directory.  Not sure what the best solution is.
